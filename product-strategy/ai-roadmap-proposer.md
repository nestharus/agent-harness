# AI Roadmap Proposer

## Purpose

Restructure the engineering roadmap into work units executable by the project's agent-driven implementation workflow. Each work unit maps to a single pass through the test/code agent separation pattern defined in `AGENTS.md`. The AI roadmap is the bridge between strategic/engineering decisions and the implementation pipeline.

This agent does not change the ordering or scope from the engineering roadmap. It decomposes each initiative into the smallest units that can flow through the implementation pipeline independently.

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the implementation pipeline

Read `AGENTS.md`, specifically:
- The 8-phase implementation pipeline (research → synthesis → proposal → 3x risk → hookpoints → test agent → code agent → CodeRabbit → PR review)
- The test/code agent separation rules (test agent sees contracts only; code agent sees contracts + tests)
- The per-feature PR workflow
- The "single concern per PR" rule from PR review
- The model roles table

### Step 2: Decompose each initiative into work units

For each initiative in `engineering-roadmap.md`, break it down into work units. A work unit is the smallest deliverable that goes through the full implementation pipeline as a single PR.

**Work unit sizing criteria:**
- A work unit introduces ONE contract boundary (a set of Pydantic schemas and/or endpoint signatures that define a coherent capability)
- A work unit's tests can be written from the contract alone, without seeing implementation
- A work unit's code makes those tests pass
- A work unit can be merged independently — the system works after merging

**Decomposition approach by type:**

For **schema/contract work units:**
- One work unit per aggregate or entity group (e.g., "Member + TrustProfile contracts" is one unit)
- Contract work units define Pydantic models, repository interfaces, and service signatures
- They do NOT implement business logic — they define the shape

For **API endpoint work units:**
- One work unit per resource (e.g., "Chapter CRUD endpoints" is one unit)
- Includes the endpoint, service, and repository layers for that resource
- Tests verify HTTP behavior (status codes, response shapes, error cases)

For **state machine work units:**
- One work unit per state machine or a coherent subset of transitions
- Includes the transition logic, validation, and audit trail generation
- Tests verify valid transitions succeed and invalid transitions fail

For **Discord interaction work units:**
- One work unit per interaction flow (e.g., "application submission modal" is one unit)
- Includes the Discord-side code and its API client calls
- Tests mock the Discord interaction and verify API calls

For **integration work units:**
- One work unit per cross-subsystem integration point
- Example: "application approval triggers roster entry creation"
- Tests verify the end-to-end flow

### Step 3: Define contracts per work unit

For each work unit, specify:

- **Contract**: The Pydantic models, endpoint signatures, or command definitions this unit introduces. These must be concrete — model field names and types, HTTP method + path + request/response shapes, command parameters.
- **Test boundary**: Exactly which files the test agent sees. Per `AGENTS.md`, this is contracts only — no service/repository/infrastructure code.
- **Code boundary**: Exactly which files the code agent implements. This is everything needed to make the tests pass.

### Step 4: Define acceptance criteria

For each work unit, write binary acceptance criteria — conditions that are unambiguously pass or fail.

**Valid criteria:**
- "POST /api/v1/members returns 201 with a Member response body containing id, discord_user_id, joined_at, and status"
- "Transition from `submitted` to `queued` generates an AuditEntry with action_type `application_queued`"
- "Update with stale ETag returns 412 Precondition Failed"

**Invalid criteria:**
- "The code is clean" (subjective)
- "Performance is acceptable" (unmeasured)
- "The implementation follows best practices" (vague)

### Step 5: Build the dependency graph

For each work unit, declare:
- **Depends on**: Which other work units must be complete before this one can start. Cite the specific output (schema, endpoint, contract) that creates the dependency.
- **Produces**: Which outputs this work unit creates that other work units may depend on.

Verify the graph is acyclic by performing a mental topological sort.

### Step 6: Map parallelization

Two work units are parallelizable if ALL of these are true:
- No dependency edge between them (direct or transitive)
- No shared output files (parallel writes to the same file are dangerous)
- No shared migration files
- Test suites can run independently

### Step 7: Assign pipeline phases per work unit

For each work unit, determine which `AGENTS.md` pipeline phases apply:

- **Research needed?** If the work unit introduces new technology or patterns not in the codebase, it needs Phase 1 (problem research) and Phase 5 (hookpoint research). If it follows existing patterns, these can be lightweight or skipped.
- **Proposal needed?** All work units need a Phase 3 proposal, but for simple pattern-following units, the proposal can be brief.
- **Risk assessment?** All work units go through Phase 4 (3x risk). For small units following established patterns, risk should be LOW quickly.
- **Model assignment**: Per `AGENTS.md` model roles table:
  - Research: gpt-high
  - Proposal: gpt-high
  - Risk: claude-opus (3x parallel)
  - Hookpoints: gpt-high
  - Test agent: gpt-high
  - Code agent: gpt-high

### Step 8: Write output

Write `ai-roadmap.md` following the output format below.

## Guardrails — what this agent does NOT do

- Does not change the ordering or initiative structure from the engineering roadmap
- Does not implement anything or write code
- Does not add features not in the engineering roadmap
- Does not invent work not described in the proposal
- Does not define vague contracts ("implement the trust system") — contracts must be concrete
- Does not combine multiple engineering initiatives into a single work unit
- Does not skip the pipeline phases from `AGENTS.md`

## Quality checklist

Before submitting output, verify:

- [ ] Every engineering roadmap initiative is decomposed into at least one work unit
- [ ] Every work unit has a concrete contract (Pydantic fields, endpoint signatures — not prose)
- [ ] Every work unit maps to a single PR concern (would pass PR review multi-concern check)
- [ ] Every work unit's test boundary contains contracts only (no implementation code)
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion is binary (pass/fail, not subjective)
- [ ] Versioned entities include optimistic locking test criteria
- [ ] Dependency graph is acyclic (topological sort succeeds)
- [ ] Model assignments follow the `AGENTS.md` model roles table
- [ ] Parallelizable work units don't share output files or migration files
- [ ] No work units are orphaned (every unit traces to an engineering initiative)
- [ ] No engineering initiative is partially decomposed (all aspects covered)

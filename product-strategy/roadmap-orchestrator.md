# Roadmap Orchestrator

## Purpose

Transform the aligned product strategy (`problem.md`, `philosophy.md`, `proposal.md`) into a prioritized, research-backed implementation roadmap and actionable tickets. The orchestrator manages a four-layer pipeline where each layer follows the same structure: research, proposal, risk assessment. Risk types are specific to each layer's failure modes. New problem surfaces at any layer trigger a return to the product strategy alignment workflow.

**Precondition:** The alignment workflow must have produced a clean run. Verify by reading `problem review.md` (zero unaddressed axes, zero misalignments) and `philosophy review.md` (zero violations, zero ungrounded decisions, zero structural concerns). If the alignment is not clean, run the alignment orchestrator (`orchestrator.md`) first.

## Model Selection

Model selection follows the guidance in `src/models.md`. Summary for this workflow:

| Role | Model | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Research planning | `claude-opus` (orchestrator) | Intent interpretation, question formulation |
| Web research execution | `gpt-high` | Focused investigation via Firecrawl; high controllability |
| Proposals (internal layers) | `gpt-high` | Constraint-aware design, systematic evaluation. Escalate to `gpt-xhigh` only on recurrence or stall |
| Public-facing documents | `claude-opus` | Executive roadmap, pitch deck — any artifact shown to stakeholders. Opus produces higher quality writing. |
| Risk assessment | `claude-opus` | Alignment checking, coherence judgment |
| Synthesis | `gpt-high` | Merging research findings into structured reports |
| Visual review | `gemini-high` | Screenshot or visual artifact review |

**Anti-patterns:**
- Do NOT pre-escalate to gpt-xhigh — gpt-high is the default proposer
- Do NOT use the orchestrator (Opus) for mechanical synthesis — delegate to gpt-high
- Do NOT use reasoning models for extraction or scanning tasks

## Tool Access

All agents invoked via the `agents` CLI have access to:
- **File system**: Read/write within the `-p` project directory
- **Bash**: Shell command execution
- **Firecrawl MCP tools**: Web search (`firecrawl_search`), page scraping (`firecrawl_scrape`), site mapping (`firecrawl_map`), structured extraction (`firecrawl_extract`), autonomous research agent (`firecrawl_agent`)

Firecrawl is the standard tool for web research. Agents use `firecrawl_search` for broad queries and `firecrawl_scrape` for extracting specific page content.

## Process

### Layer 0: Market Research

Market research follows the research-first pattern: the orchestrator (Opus) plans the research questions, gpt-high agents execute web research via Firecrawl, and a gpt-high synthesis agent merges findings.

#### Stage 0a: Research Planning (Orchestrator)

The orchestrator identifies what market research questions need answering and writes focused research prompts. Each prompt targets a specific research domain so agents can work in parallel.

**Research domains to cover:**

1. **General guild management bots** — MEE6, Carl-bot, Dyno, YAGPDB, Arcane: feature sets, pricing, limitations, user complaints
2. **Application/intake bots** — Gather, and any Discord application/onboarding-specific bots: form builders, application workflows, review tools
3. **Ticketing bots** — Ticket Tool, alternatives to the discontinued ticketsbot.net, support/moderation ticket systems
4. **Activity/roster tracking tools** — Gaming guild roster management, activity tracking, attendance, DKP/point systems
5. **Permission and role management bots** — Wick, role management tools, permission audit tools
6. **Guild management platforms** — Tools beyond individual bots: full guild management suites, web dashboards, multi-function platforms

For each domain, write a research prompt to `.tmp/` that instructs the agent to:
- Use `firecrawl_search` to find competitors, reviews, and user discussions
- Use `firecrawl_scrape` to extract specific feature/pricing details from competitor websites
- Map findings to the 7 proposal subsystems (Identity/Trust, Intake, Cases, Chapters, Activity/Compliance, Permissions, Governance)
- Write structured findings to the specified output file in `market-data/`

#### Stage 0b: Research Execution (gpt-high, parallel)

Dispatch gpt-high agents for each research domain. Each agent operates on its own worktree.

```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel research
git worktree add worktrees/research-general -b research-general
git worktree add worktrees/research-applications -b research-applications
git worktree add worktrees/research-tickets -b research-tickets
git worktree add worktrees/research-activity -b research-activity
git worktree add worktrees/research-permissions -b research-permissions
git worktree add worktrees/research-platforms -b research-platforms

# Run in parallel — each agent uses Firecrawl for web research
agents -m gpt-high -p worktrees/research-general -f .tmp/research-general.md &
agents -m gpt-high -p worktrees/research-applications -f .tmp/research-applications.md &
agents -m gpt-high -p worktrees/research-tickets -f .tmp/research-tickets.md &
agents -m gpt-high -p worktrees/research-activity -f .tmp/research-activity.md &
agents -m gpt-high -p worktrees/research-permissions -f .tmp/research-permissions.md &
agents -m gpt-high -p worktrees/research-platforms -f .tmp/research-platforms.md &
wait

# Collect outputs into market-data/ and merge into three structured files:
# market-data/competitors.md, market-data/user-reviews.md, market-data/value-signals.md
# Clean up worktrees
```

Each research agent writes its findings to `market-data/` within its worktree. The orchestrator collects and merges into the three canonical files:

- `competitors.md` — Competitor feature matrix with source URLs. Organized by subsystem. Per competitor: what they offer, what they lack, pricing model, known user complaints.
- `user-reviews.md` — Categorized user feedback with provenance. Each entry: source URL, date, community type, pain point, subsystem mapping.
- `value-signals.md` — Ranked signal list. Each signal: what users want, evidence count, subsystem mapping, signal strength (strong/moderate/weak).

**Gate: Human.** Present the gathered data to the user. The user confirms completeness or directs additional research on specific competitors or topics.

#### Stage 0c: Market Research Synthesis (gpt-high)

Run the market research synthesis agent:

```bash
agents -m gpt-high -p <worktree> -f product-strategy/market\ research\ agent.md
```

**Inputs provided to agent:**
- `market-data/competitors.md`
- `market-data/user-reviews.md`
- `market-data/value-signals.md`
- `proposal.md` (for subsystem structure reference)
- `problem.md` (for problem axis alignment)

**Outputs:**
- `market-research.md` (always written)
- `market-surfaces.md` (only if surfaces found)

#### Stage 0d: Surface Check

Check whether `market-surfaces.md` was produced.

If produced: **pause the roadmap pipeline.** Feed the surfaces into the product strategy alignment workflow:
1. Run the problem alignment review with the surfaces as additional input
2. Follow through expansion, philosophy review, philosophy expansion as needed
3. If the proposer must update `proposal.md`, run the proposer
4. Run alignment to convergence (clean run)
5. Resume the roadmap pipeline at Layer 1 (executive roadmap)

If not produced: proceed to Layer 1.

---

### Layer 1: Executive Roadmap

#### Stage 1a: Executive Roadmap Proposal (gpt-high)

Run the executive roadmap proposer:

```bash
agents -m gpt-high -p <worktree> -f product-strategy/executive\ roadmap\ proposer.md
```

If the proposer fails or produces a roadmap that cannot pass risk after 2 revision cycles, escalate to gpt-xhigh for the next attempt.

**Inputs provided to agent:**
- `proposal.md`
- `problem.md`
- `philosophy.md`
- `market-research.md`

**Outputs:**
- `executive-roadmap.md` (always written)
- `executive-surfaces.md` (only if surfaces found)

#### Stage 1b: Executive Risk Assessment (3x claude-opus, parallel)

Construct three risk assessment prompts from `roadmap-risk-types.md`, section "Executive Roadmap Risks." Each prompt includes:
- The risk type definition, severity criteria, and assessment checklist from `roadmap-risk-types.md`
- The artifact being assessed: `executive-roadmap.md`
- The cross-reference documents specified for that risk type
- The output format from `roadmap-risk-types.md`

Write the constructed prompts to `.tmp/` and run all three in parallel:

```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel execution
git worktree add worktrees/exec-risk-market -b exec-risk-market
git worktree add worktrees/exec-risk-dependency -b exec-risk-dependency
git worktree add worktrees/exec-risk-completeness -b exec-risk-completeness

# Run in parallel
agents -m claude-opus -p worktrees/exec-risk-market -f .tmp/executive-risk-market-misread.md &
agents -m claude-opus -p worktrees/exec-risk-dependency -f .tmp/executive-risk-dependency-trap.md &
agents -m claude-opus -p worktrees/exec-risk-completeness -f .tmp/executive-risk-completeness.md &
wait

# Collect outputs to plans/risk/
# Clean up worktrees
```

**Risk types:**
1. **Market misread** — Are value assessments evidence-based?
2. **Dependency trap** — Does the ordering create fragile critical paths?
3. **Completeness** — Are all proposal subsystems covered?

See `roadmap-risk-types.md` for full definitions.

**All three must return LOW.** If any returns MEDIUM or HIGH:

1. Read the findings from all three risk reports
2. Identify the resolution path from `roadmap-risk-types.md` for each non-LOW finding
3. Execute the resolution (may involve additional research, proposer revision, or both)
4. Re-run the **full risk gate** (all three risk types) — do not cherry-pick

#### Stage 1c: Surface Check

Check whether `executive-surfaces.md` was produced by stage 1a.

If produced: pause, run product strategy alignment cycle, resume based on impact (see Resume Rules below).

#### Stage 1d: Human Gate

Present the executive roadmap to the user. Include:
- The initiative ordering with value justification
- The phase structure
- Opportunity cost statements
- Risk assessment verdicts (all LOW)

The user may: approve, reorder initiatives, merge/split slices, reject competitive analysis, or request changes. If changes are substantial, re-run the risk gate on the revised roadmap.

---

### Layer 2: Engineering Roadmap

#### Stage 2a: Engineering Research (gpt-high)

Run the engineering codebase research agent:

```bash
agents -m gpt-high -p <worktree> -f product-strategy/engineering\ research\ agent.md
```

**Inputs provided to agent:**
- `executive-roadmap.md`
- `proposal.md`
- The full codebase (agent reads `services/`, `daemon/`, `tests/`, `migrations/`, etc.)
- `DECISIONS.md`
- Existing research in `plans/research/`

**Outputs:**
- `engineering-research.md` (always written) — Technical landscape report: what exists, what is draft-state, what is production-ready, shared infrastructure needs, technical constraints

#### Stage 2b: Engineering Roadmap Proposal (gpt-high)

Run the engineering roadmap proposer:

```bash
agents -m gpt-high -p <worktree> -f product-strategy/engineering\ roadmap\ proposer.md
```

**Inputs provided to agent:**
- `executive-roadmap.md`
- `engineering-research.md`
- `proposal.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`

**Outputs:**
- `engineering-roadmap.md` (always written)
- `engineering-surfaces.md` (only if surfaces found)

#### Stage 2c: Engineering Risk Assessment (3x claude-opus, parallel)

Same pattern as Stage 1b. Construct three prompts from `roadmap-risk-types.md`, section "Engineering Roadmap Risks."

**Risk types:**
1. **Feasibility** — Are effort estimates realistic?
2. **Integration** — Will independently-built slices integrate?
3. **Drift** — Does engineering add/drop/reinterpret executive priorities?

**All three must return LOW.** If any is not LOW, follow the resolution path in `roadmap-risk-types.md` and re-run the full gate.

#### Stage 2d: Surface Check

Check whether `engineering-surfaces.md` was produced by stage 2b.

If produced: pause, run product strategy alignment cycle, resume based on impact.

#### Stage 2e: Human Gate

Present the engineering roadmap to the user. Highlight:
- Any pushback on executive ordering (with cost/value tradeoff stated)
- Foundation phase contents (if extracted)
- Effort estimates and risk flags
- Parallelization opportunities

The user resolves any ordering disagreements between executive and engineering perspectives.

---

### Layer 3: AI-Optimized Roadmap

#### Stage 3a: AI Roadmap Proposal (gpt-high)

Run the AI roadmap proposer:

```bash
agents -m gpt-high -p <worktree> -f product-strategy/ai\ roadmap\ proposer.md
```

**Inputs provided to agent:**
- `engineering-roadmap.md`
- `proposal.md`
- The full codebase
- `AGENTS.md` (for implementation workflow patterns)

**Outputs:**
- `ai-roadmap.md` (always written)

#### Stage 3b: AI Risk Assessment (3x claude-opus, parallel)

Same pattern. Construct three prompts from `roadmap-risk-types.md`, section "AI Roadmap Risks."

**Risk types:**
1. **Decomposition** — Are work unit boundaries clean?
2. **Coverage** — Is every engineering item decomposed?
3. **Dependency** — Is the dependency graph acyclic?

**All three must return LOW.** If any is not LOW, follow the resolution path and re-run the full gate.

#### Stage 3c: Model Gate

The orchestrator validates:
- Every engineering roadmap slice appears in the AI roadmap
- The dependency graph is acyclic (topological sort succeeds)
- Model assignments follow the model roles table in `AGENTS.md`

No human gate — this is a formatting transformation of the already-approved engineering roadmap.

---

### Layer 4: Ticket Generation

#### Stage 4a: Ticket Generation (gpt-high)

Run the ticket generation agent:

```bash
agents -m gpt-high -p <worktree> -f product-strategy/ticket\ generation\ agent.md
```

**Inputs provided to agent:**
- `ai-roadmap.md`
- `proposal.md`
- `problem.md`
- `philosophy.md`
- `market-research.md`
- `executive-roadmap.md`

**Outputs:**
- `tickets/INDEX.md` (always written)
- `tickets/INIT-NNN.md` (one per initiative)
- `tickets/SLICE-NNN.md` (one per value slice)

#### Stage 4b: Human Gate

Present the generated tickets to the user. Tickets are the final deliverable that feeds into the Implementation & Bug-Fix Workflow from `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Surface Handling

When any proposer agent produces a surfaces file (`market-surfaces.md`, `executive-surfaces.md`, or `engineering-surfaces.md`):

1. **Pause** the roadmap pipeline at the current layer. Record which layer paused and what surfaces triggered the pause.

2. **Run** the product strategy alignment cycle:
   - Feed surfaces into the problem alignment review as additional input
   - Follow through problem expansion, philosophy alignment, philosophy expansion as the alignment orchestrator dictates
   - If the alignment cycle produces changes that require a proposal update, run the proposer
   - Run alignment to convergence (clean run)

3. **Assess impact and resume:**
   - If `proposal.md` was not changed: resume from the paused layer with updated `problem.md`/`philosophy.md`
   - If `proposal.md` was changed: restart from Layer 1 (executive roadmap). Market data does not re-gather unless the problem space fundamentally changed (new subsystems, removed subsystems).
   - If the problem space fundamentally changed (new subsystems added to the proposal, or existing subsystems substantially redesigned): restart from Layer 0 (market research).

4. **User decides** restart scope when the impact is ambiguous. Present the changes and ask: "The problem definition was expanded with [new axes]. The proposal was [changed/unchanged]. Which layer should we restart from?"

5. **Delete** the surfaces file after processing.

---

## Resume Rules After Product Strategy Detour

| Change scope | Resume point | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| New problem axes, proposal unchanged | Paused layer | The strategic ordering is still valid |
| Proposal updated (minor) | Layer 1 (executive) | Strategic value assessment may change |
| Proposal updated (new subsystem) | Layer 0 (market research) | Need competitive data for new scope |
| Philosophy updated, proposal unchanged | Paused layer | Ordering is strategic, not philosophical |

Layers prior to the resume point do NOT re-run automatically. The user confirms whether earlier outputs need revision.

---

## Risk Resolution Protocol

When a risk assessment returns MEDIUM or HIGH at any layer:

1. **Read all three risk reports** for that layer, not just the non-LOW one.
2. **Identify the resolution path** for each non-LOW finding from `roadmap-risk-types.md`.
3. **Execute resolutions** in order:
   - If resolution requires additional research: dispatch a gpt-high research agent with a focused prompt (the agent uses Firecrawl for web research or reads the codebase as appropriate)
   - If resolution requires proposal revision: run the proposer with the risk findings as additional input (append risk findings to the prompt)
4. **Re-run the full risk gate** — all three risk types, not just the ones that were non-LOW. Revisions can introduce new issues.
5. **Maximum 3 revision cycles** per layer. If risk is still not all-LOW after 3 cycles, present the findings to the user. The user decides whether to accept the risk, provide additional direction, or abandon the layer.

---

## Run Report

After each layer completes (all risk gates LOW, human/model gate passed), produce a brief status report:

```
Layer N: [name]
  Proposer: [model] — [output file]
  Risk gate: [all LOW / required N revision cycles]
  Surfaces: [none / found and processed]
  Human gate: [approved / approved with changes]
  Next: Layer N+1
```

After all layers complete, produce a final summary listing all output files and the dependency path from market research through tickets.

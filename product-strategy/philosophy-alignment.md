# Philosophy Alignment Review

## Purpose

For problems the proposal is correctly aimed at (passed Stage 1), determine whether the proposal solves them in a way that embodies the product philosophy. The reference document is the product philosophy. The output is a list of violations — places where the proposal's design contradicts or fails to embody a principle.

This is Stage 2. It only applies to axes that passed Stage 1 (problem alignment). A proposal that is aimed at the wrong problem doesn't need philosophy review — it needs to be re-aimed first.

---

## Inputs

- **Product philosophy** (`philosophy.md`) — the principles that govern how we think and design
- **Proposal** (`proposal.md`) — the system design being reviewed
- **Problem review** (`problem-review.md`) — Stage 1 output containing the list of aligned axes to review

## Outputs

- **Philosophy review** (`philosophy-review.md`) — alignment findings for the proposer
- **Philosophy surfaces** (`philosophy-surfaces.md`) — new philosophical concerns discovered during review (only written if surfaces are found)

---

## What this review does

For each axis that passed Stage 1:

1. Read the proposal's design decisions for that axis — schema objects, workflows, governance mechanisms, AI/ML approaches, constraints, and how it handles edge cases.

2. For each design decision, ask:
   - Is this decision traceable to a principle? Which one?
   - Does this decision contradict a principle? Which one, and how?
   - When the proposal encounters a difficulty on this axis, does it respond the way the philosophy would predict? Or does it take a shortcut that undermines a principle?

3. Classify the result:
   - **Embodied** — the design decisions on this axis are consistent with the philosophy. No output needed.
   - **Violation** — a specific design decision contradicts a specific principle. Describe both.
   - **Ungrounded** — a design decision exists that isn't traceable to any principle and isn't obviously wrong, but has no philosophical basis. This is a flag, not necessarily a problem — it may indicate a missing principle or a design decision that needs justification.

4. For ungrounded decisions, go one step further in two ways:

   a. **Check the implementation against existing principles.** An ungrounded decision may have a defensible intent that doesn't trace to a principle, but its *implementation mechanism* may violate existing principles. Examine not just what the decision is trying to achieve, but how the proposal achieves it. If the implementation contradicts a principle, that is a **violation**, not just an ungrounded finding. For example: a decision to add safeguards (intent: harm prevention, ungrounded) that bakes in fixed enforcement levels rather than making them customer-configurable (implementation: violates Principles 4 and 6) should be classified as a violation on the implementation, with the ungrounded intent noted separately.

   b. **Articulate the implicit principle.** If the decision is coherent and the reasoning is identifiable, describe the implicit principle the decision appears to embody — the philosophy expansion agent needs this to evaluate whether the philosophy should grow.

### Surface discovery

While performing the per-axis review, watch for philosophical concerns that the current philosophy does not address. These take three forms:

**Implicit principles.** An ungrounded design decision embodies a coherent philosophy that isn't articulated in any existing principle. The decision makes sense, but the principle behind it is missing from the philosophy.

**Principle tensions.** The proposal's approach to an axis reveals a tension between two existing principles that the philosophy doesn't acknowledge or resolve. The principles may coexist in general but conflict in this specific context.

**New philosophical axes.** The proposal introduces a concern — a way of thinking about design — that is entirely absent from the philosophy. Not a missing principle within an existing concern, but a concern the philosophy doesn't address at all. Examples: the philosophy addresses transparency and trust but says nothing about adaptability; the proposal makes adaptability-driven decisions with no philosophical grounding.

If any philosophical surfaces are found, write them to `philosophy-surfaces.md`. If none are found, do not create the file.

## What this review does NOT do

- **Does not re-check problem alignment.** That was Stage 1. If an axis is on the aligned list, accept it.
- **Does not evaluate implementation quality.** Whether a mechanism is well-engineered is not the question. Whether it embodies the principles is.
- **Does not prescribe solutions.** If a violation is found, the output is the violation — not a redesign.
- **Does not update the philosophy.** New philosophical concerns are captured in `philosophy-surfaces.md` for the expansion agent. This review does not modify `philosophy.md`.
- **Does not address roadmap concerns.**

---

## How to read the philosophy

The philosophy contains:
- **Principles** (numbered 1–12) — each describes how we think about a specific aspect of design
- **Principle interactions** — how principles reinforce each other
- **Expansion guidance** — how principles apply when encountering new problem surfaces

When checking a design decision:
- First check against the specific principle most relevant to the decision
- Then check against principle interactions — a decision can satisfy one principle while violating another
- For new capabilities the proposal introduces, check against the expansion guidance

---

## Common violation patterns

These are patterns that tend to recur. They're guides for the reviewer, not an exhaustive list.

**Permission theater (violates principles 1, 7).** The proposal grants authority labels without bounded scope or clear effect. Look for: officer roles with implicit "can do everything in their chapter" semantics without defined boundaries, delegated authority without recorded scope, role names that imply trust without mechanisms to verify it.

**Silent state mutation (violates principles 1, 2, 10).** The proposal changes operational state without explicit operator awareness. Look for: automated role assignments without notification, chapter state transitions without officer confirmation, background cleanup that modifies membership records without logging, configuration changes that take effect without acknowledgment.

**Shim creep (violates principle 3).** The proposal builds compatibility bridges to legacy bot configurations or deprecated Discord features. Look for: import paths from old bot dashboards, reaction-role emulation when community onboarding exists, adapters that translate between old and new models instead of clean migration, Welcome Screen support when Discord has moved to Onboarding.

**Build-first shortcuts (violates principle 4).** The proposal implements mechanisms before the problem they solve has been researched. Look for: schema objects that don't trace to a problem definition axis, workflows copied from existing bots without understanding why they were designed that way, solutions for problems the problem definition doesn't describe.

**Vendor entanglement (violates principle 5).** The proposal creates dependencies that are hard to exit. Look for: operational data stored only in external dashboards, transcripts in vendor-proprietary formats, configuration that lives in a third-party system rather than the community's database, critical workflows that fail if a specific bot or service disappears.

**Unaccountable authority (violates principles 6, 7).** The proposal grants decision-making power without audit trails or scope boundaries. Look for: officer actions that aren't logged, moderation decisions without recorded reasons, application adjudication without reviewer attribution, authority that increases with rank while accountability decreases.

**Fighting the platform (violates principle 8).** The proposal works against Discord's interaction model rather than with it. Look for: custom UI systems that replicate Discord components, assumptions about modal or component behavior from stale documentation, workarounds for platform constraints that create fragile state, designs that break when Discord updates its component model.

**Burnout amplification (violates principle 9).** The proposal adds mandatory human touchpoints without demonstrated risk justification. Look for: approval gates for low-consequence actions, notification floods that train officers to ignore alerts, review requirements that exist for oversight optics rather than genuine risk mitigation, workflows that can't complete without officer intervention for routine state transitions.

**Ephemeral critical state (violates principle 10).** The proposal relies on Discord messages, reactions, or channel structure as durable operational state. Look for: membership decisions recorded only as Discord messages, configuration stored in pinned posts or channel topics, workflow state that disappears when a channel is deleted or archived, operational context that requires reading chat history to reconstruct.

**Deployment-gated configuration (violates principle 11).** The proposal requires code changes or redeployment for operational configuration. Look for: activity thresholds in config files that operators can't change from Discord, application form definitions in source code, chapter settings that require developer intervention to modify, configuration that can't be changed without restarting the bot.

**Brittle coupling (violates principle 12).** The proposal creates dependencies where one subsystem failure breaks unrelated subsystems. Look for: ticket creation that fails if the application system is down, chapter provisioning that blocks on activity tracking availability, shared database transactions that lock across subsystem boundaries, cascading failures from a single external dependency outage.

## Output format

### Violations

For each violation:
- **Axis:** which problem surface
- **Design decision:** what the proposal does
- **Principle violated:** which principle (by number and name)
- **How it's violated:** specific description of the contradiction
- **Why this matters:** what goes wrong if the violation persists

### Ungrounded decisions

For each ungrounded decision:
- **Axis:** which problem surface
- **Design decision:** what the proposal does
- **Observation:** why it's not traceable to a principle
- **Question:** what should the proposer consider — is this a missing principle, or a decision that needs justification?

### Structural concerns

Design-level issues that aren't about individual principle violations but about how the system's internal mechanisms interact:
- Are there places where mechanisms will conflict as the system grows?
- Are there governance gaps in the proposal's own internal design?

These must be system design concerns, not roadmap concerns.

## Philosophy surfaces output format (`philosophy-surfaces.md`)

Only written if new philosophical concerns are found. Omit entirely if there are none.

### Implicit principles

For each ungrounded decision that embodies a coherent but unarticulated philosophy:
- **Axis:** which problem surface
- **Design decision:** what the proposal does
- **Implicit principle:** the principle the decision appears to embody (articulated by the reviewer)
- **Relationship to existing principles:** does it extend an existing principle, or is it independent?
- **Strength of evidence:** how many decisions in the proposal appear to follow this same implicit principle?

### Principle tensions

For each tension between existing principles revealed by the proposal:
- **Axis:** which problem surface
- **Principles in tension:** which principles (by number and name) and how they conflict in this context
- **How the proposal resolves it:** what the proposal does when the principles pull in different directions
- **What the philosophy doesn't say:** the guidance the philosophy is missing for resolving this tension

### New philosophical axes

For each concern the philosophy doesn't address at all:
- **Concern:** what the proposal is reasoning about that has no philosophical grounding
- **Evidence from proposal:** which design decisions reveal this concern
- **Why it's not covered:** why no existing principle addresses this — it's not a gap in an existing principle, it's an entirely absent concern
- **Questions for the user:** what direction should this axis point? What is the user's stance on this concern? (The expansion agent cannot resolve this without user input.)

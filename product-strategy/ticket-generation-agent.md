# Ticket Generation Agent

## Purpose

Produce implementation tickets from the AI-optimized roadmap, each backed by a justification chain tracing from market research through the problem definition, proposal design, executive priority, and engineering assessment to the specific work units. Tickets are the final deliverable that feeds into the Implementation & Bug-Fix Workflow from `AGENTS.md`.

## Process

### Step 1: Build the justification chain structure

The justification chain for any ticket traces through six layers:

```
Market signal → Problem axis → Proposal mechanism → Executive priority → Engineering assessment → Work units
```

For each initiative in the AI roadmap, trace this chain:

1. **Market signal**: Which finding in `market-research.md` supports this initiative's value? (evidence strength, competitor comparison)
2. **Problem axis**: Which axis in `problem.md` does this initiative address? (axis number and name)
3. **Proposal mechanism**: Which section of `proposal.md` describes the design? (schema objects, state machines, workflows)
4. **Executive priority**: What is this initiative's phase and composite score in `executive-roadmap.md`? (pain severity, competitive position, dependency depth, delay risk)
5. **Engineering assessment**: What is the effort/risk from `engineering-roadmap.md`? (T-shirt size, risk factors, foundation dependencies)
6. **Work units**: Which WU-NNN entries in `ai-roadmap.md` implement this? (contracts, test boundary, code boundary)

### Step 2: Generate initiative tickets (INIT)

For each initiative group in the roadmap (a set of related value slices that address one subsystem area), generate an `INIT-NNN.md` ticket. Initiative tickets provide strategic context — they explain WHY this work matters.

Number initiatives sequentially: INIT-001, INIT-002, etc., ordered by roadmap phase and priority.

### Step 3: Generate value slice tickets (SLICE)

For each value slice within an initiative (one or more work units that deliver a single operator-visible capability), generate a `SLICE-NNN.md` ticket. Slice tickets provide implementation specification — they explain WHAT to build and HOW to verify.

Number slices sequentially: SLICE-001, SLICE-002, etc., ordered by dependency (upstream slices get lower numbers).

### Step 4: Generate the index

Generate `tickets/INDEX.md` with:
- Complete list of all tickets with one-line descriptions
- Dependency graph showing which tickets block which
- Phase grouping
- Critical path through the tickets

### Step 5: Validate completeness

Verify:
- Every work unit in `ai-roadmap.md` appears in at least one SLICE ticket
- Every SLICE ticket traces to an INIT ticket
- Every INIT ticket has a complete justification chain (all 6 layers)
- The dependency graph in INDEX.md is consistent with the AI roadmap's dependency graph

## Guardrails — what this agent does NOT do

- Does not modify any input file
- Does not invent work not described in the AI roadmap
- Does not skip any layer of the justification chain — every ticket must trace from market signal through work units
- Does not combine multiple value slices into a single ticket
- Does not combine multiple initiatives into a single ticket
- Does not reorder or reprioritize — the ordering comes from the roadmap
- Does not estimate effort independently — effort comes from the engineering roadmap

## Quality checklist

Before submitting output, verify:

- [ ] Every work unit from the AI roadmap appears in at least one SLICE ticket
- [ ] Every SLICE ticket traces to an INIT ticket
- [ ] Every INIT ticket has a complete justification chain (all 6 layers filled in)
- [ ] No justification layer references a market signal, problem axis, or principle that doesn't exist in the source files
- [ ] No SLICE ticket combines multiple value slices
- [ ] INDEX.md dependency graph is consistent with AI roadmap dependency graph
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are binary (pass/fail)
- [ ] Every SLICE ticket describes an operator-visible capability change (not just technical work)
- [ ] Ticket numbering is sequential and consistent across all files
- [ ] Foundation work appears as SLICE tickets (not INIT tickets — foundations don't have strategic justification chains)
